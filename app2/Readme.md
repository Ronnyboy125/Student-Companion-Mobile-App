# APP 2: Code Development of First Prototype Application
#### CS-375 - Whitworth University

## Objectives:
1. Develop the first prototype or beta application. 
2. Define the architecture and top level modules.
3. Practice pair programming where feasible.
4. Communicate within the group and make sure everyone is heard. 
5. Present on progress to the group

## Presentation
For the mini presentations we want to hear about:
1. How is the team organizing itself and keeping on task
2. How has the design changed since your last presentation. Have you updated your design documents?
3. What challenges you are facing
4. What your prototype looks like now (if you have something to show)

## Evaluation
You will be evaluated on:
- Progress made towards the prototype application.
- Good commit messages, good branch management within git.
- Progress made towards development of good communication and cooperating skills within the team.
- Creativity and design in the actual prototype application.

CS375-1 APP1: Functional Specification & Schedule Document
===========================================================

# Instructions:
* Each group must edit this document to complete each of the Functional/Feature Specifications for their project.
* Note: This specification document should and  will change over the course of the project as you learn more through an iterative development process. 
* You may make changes to your feature list, rankings, etc. Your job is to keep this specification up to date for the life of the project! 
* Each time you make a change you must sync that change to the project Functional Specification sub folder and this document.

# Group Members:
List all the group members here.

# Project Title
This section should include a good functional/feature description of the project (a minimum of  three paragraphs). If you have previously proposed this same project, you can re-use what you wrote previously here.

# Project Mission/Vision
This section should state the mission or vision of your project. It should be short (1-3 sentences) and easily memorable.

# Project Description
This section should include a good functional/feature description of the project (a minimum of  three paragraphs). If you have previously proposed this same project, you can re-use what you wrote previously here.

# Target Platforms
In this section, specify which mobile devices your application will  target (e.g. Android, iPad, iPhone, Web, Windows, Mac, etc...) and why you are targeting those devices.

# Class Design

## List of Likely Classes and Plugins
This section will contain a list of Flutter classes that your group thinks you might need to use. 

You don't have to include UML diagrams of the Flutter classes or class hierarchies in this section (they are already documented online), rather, just list the classes from Flutter you think you might use. This will need to change in the future as you learn what works and what does not work! Give URLs to these as appropriate.

## Custom Classes 
Depending on your project, you may need to design custom class hierarchies to manage the data for your custom application. For example, in the example asteroids game there are class hierarchies for Ships, Bullets, etc.

It will take some research to determine what class hierarchies you can re-use from Flutter and what you will need to design from scratch. 

## UML Diagrams
You must use UML diagrams to illustrate any of your group designed class hierarchies and you must include those diagrams in this section of this file.

# Ranked List of Proposed Features 
List all the features that you hope your app will have.
For each feature give it a short name (e.g. high score histories, splash page, settings menu, etc...)
For each feature write a short description of that feature.
For each feature give two rank values: necessity and difficulty.
Sort the list by necessity first and difficulty second. Thus the most necessary features that are the easiest to implement should be listed first, etc.

# Proposed Schedule
Here you will put a proposed schedule of when you plan to complete each feature described in the previous section. You should have major milestones with dates as well in this schedule.

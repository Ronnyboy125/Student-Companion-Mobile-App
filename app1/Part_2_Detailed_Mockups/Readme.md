CS375-1 APP1: User Interface Design
====================================

# Instructions:
* Each group must create screen mock-ups drawings for all the features described in the functional specification.
* Include each major screen that the app will display
* e.g. Splash screen, settings screen, data screen, etc...
* Above each screen describe the purpose of that screen and how the user will interact with it.
* Read about the principles of Material design https://material.io/design/ when designing your interface. You don't have to have a perfect first interface design, but head in the right direction!

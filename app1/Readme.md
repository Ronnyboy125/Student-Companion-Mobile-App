# APP 1: Functional Specification and Detailed Mockups
#### CS-375 - Whitworth University
Updated 3/05/2024

## Objectives:
1. Decide on what "features" that your mobile application will have. Rank each of these features by both desirability and by your perceived difficulty of implementation.
2. As a group complete the Feature Specification (also called a Functional Specification) in the Part_1_Functional_Spec subfolder.
3. Complete the design of the major prototype screens in the Part_2_Detailed_Mockups subfolder. You can start "mocking up" the screens using the principles of Flutter layout from class and from [the Flutter dev website ](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout)

## Evaluation
You will be graded on:
- Functional specification features are reasonable and accurately described. 
- Achievable schedule (the schedule is the last part of the functional specification)
- Creative mockups with good design and UI principles
- Good use of git branches and collaborative work

A feature that sets Notion apart from its competitors is flexibility, which allows users to customize their workspace based on their needs using Notion’s built-in features. <br> <br>


There are a few disadvantages of Notion. Its mobile app does not have the functionalities that the desktop version offers and due to Notion’s customization tools, it is overwhelming to use, and it takes time to get used to Notion. <br> <br>

 
Individuals and small groups tend to use Notion’s free version and bigger groups or large organizations that need additional features and tools use Notion Plus, which is $8 per month for each user, Notion Business, $15 per month for each user, and Notion Enterprise, which organizations need to contact Notion to get a quote.  <br>

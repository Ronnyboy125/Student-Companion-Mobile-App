## Purpose
* You are laying the groundwork for future group projects. The next group will carry your work forward.

## Part 2-1: The Updated Idea(s): 


  
<ins> Features: </ins> <br>
1. The app connects with Blackboard and with Blackboard’s calendar (assignment/quiz due dates). <br>
2. Gives reminders when assignments/quizzes are due. <br>
3. Based on user's input of how many hours they study, give recommendation of how many hours they should study for each class and when they should take a break <br>
4. Board system - students can post information about events, intramural times, studying times, and hangouts (Similar to pirate port but more geared towards students interacting with each other). <br>


<ins> Information Architecture of the App: </ins> <br> 
Log in/sign up -> verify that you’re Whitworth student -> app gets access to your Blackboard data -> Home screen <br>

Things in menu:  <br>
1. Account ->upload profile pictures, account settings<br>
2. Calendar ->add your class schedules  <br>
3. Courses -> can add your syllabus info, any info about classes, customize color or text of class (similar to canvas)  <br>
4. Board -> maybe show notifications of posts that you posted in board  <br>
5. To do -> create to-do lists <br>
6. Recommendation -> optional (turn on or turn off) <br>

<ins>Detailed App Description: </ins> <br> 
When you open the app you will come up on a login screen where you will be able to login or create an account. If you create an account you will be prompted to select your school and go through a verification process to connect your account with your student account and access certain data. After you login you will land on the home page where you will be presented with a few different options. You will be able to go to your account page, calendar, courses, boards, to do lists and recommendations. Your account page will allow you to edit any of your info on the app and maintain your connection to your school (opt out or change/verify info for security reasons). You will also be able to select a profile picture if you like. The calendar will be integrated with your student account to show you a clean space with all of your assignments and due dates. You will also be able to add anything you want or delete anything you want like a normal online calendar. The courses tab will hold your courses and hold basic information that can be taken from your schools account or entered manually. It will hold the course name, current grades and location of class. The boards tab will be a place where people can post messages for everyone affiliated with the school to see. It can be a place where people can post events like ASWU, RA nights and sports events at the UREC. It can also be a place where people can offer tutoring or places to hold group studies. People would be able to reply to it and there could be a poll or something of that aspect posted with the board, but there will be no direct messaging system in the app (unless that needs to be changed for this to work effectively). The to do lists will be an extension of the calendar. It will allow students to set to do tasks for the day and to receive reminders to do them. It can also be set up to let you know when you have an assignment due or if you have an upcoming exam. Finally the recommendations tab is a fully optional idea that students will be able to set up if they wish. You will be able to decide what kind of recommendations you want and then the application will ask you basic questions to be able to figure out what to give you. For example if you set up recommendations for homework, then it will ask you questions like how long do assignments normally take, what days you do your homework on and to ask how many tasks you have planned for the day. Then using that info and your calendar information the app will recommend times for you to do your homework, times for you to take a break, times for you to go out and do something fun etc. Another example could be if you have bad time management skills you could feed the application some answers to questions like “when are you most productive” and “what time do you normally go to bed” and fill out your calendar with set times for things you do like classes, work, events etc. and the app will recommend times you should do things throughout the week like good times to do your homework, good times to make plans and go out and good times for other events that you can manually enter.

# Student Companion App market Research

## Evernote vs Student Companion

Based on my market research, it was challenging to find an application similar to Student Companion. Student Companion integrates a calendar system, recommendations, events, grades, intramurals, and boards all in one place. A widely popular application among college students is Evernote. Evernote excels at managing projects, scheduling tasks, storing data, and sharing information and schedules. However, the issue with Evernote is that it is not specifically designed for students and is used by people in various professions. For instance, software engineers use it to track coding problems they solve and the methods they implement.

Our application, Student Companion, will help students in utilizing the calendar system to keep track of all their assignments, making sure they are reminded of due dates for assignments or upcoming exams/quizzes. It will also enable them to schedule routine activities for specific days or times. The app will then provide recommendations on how much time they should spend on homework based on user-input data, when to take breaks, any needed distress measures, or any personal recommendations they decide to add.
